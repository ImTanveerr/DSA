/*Given a set of activities, each with different durations and varying profits, 
you need to select the maximum number of activities to maximize profit:
Activity 1: (Start = 2, Finish = 5, Profit = 50)
Activity 2: (Start = 1, Finish = 4, Profit = 40)
Activity 3: (Start = 3, Finish = 8, Profit = 100)
Activity 4: (Start = 6, Finish = 10, Profit = 70)
Activity 5: (Start = 8, Finish = 11, Profit = 60)
Maximize the profit while ensuring that the activities do not overlap.



Given a list of activities with start and end times, maximize the total duration of the activities selected:
Activity 1: (Start = 2, Finish = 6)
Activity 2: (Start = 1, Finish = 3)
Activity 3: (Start = 7, Finish = 10)
Activity 4: (Start = 5, Finish = 8)
Activity 5: (Start = 9, Finish = 12)
Choose the activities that maximize the total time spent on all selected activities, instead of the number of activities.
